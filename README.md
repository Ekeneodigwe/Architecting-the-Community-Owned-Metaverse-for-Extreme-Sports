# Architecting-the-Community-Owned-Metaverse-for-Extreme-Sports
This repository provides an overview of my technological strategy and decentralized metaverse initiatives I led for GO WFO - the world's leading extreme sports community

# Featuring:

⚡️ The phase-by-phase web3 adoption roadmap spanning tokenized incentives, NFT integrations and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) formation

🚜 Initial smart contract frameworks coded for fractionalized NFT collections sharing sport star sponsorship revenues with fans

🏂 3D interactive metaverse prototype builds enabling immersed first-person view extreme sport experiences

🧗🏿‍♀️ Results from an empirical study with 1000+ community members assessing web3 perception, pricing models for digital collectibles and more

🤝 Partnership case study with leading generative NFT platform to introduce recurring limited edition artifact drops celebrating the history and culture of the sport

🔁 Token distribution schedules balancing incentive alignment across Web2 convert timing vs. Web3 native users

The aim - architecting an ownerless metaverse where both the culture and economics of extreme sports thrive on chain into perpetuity.
